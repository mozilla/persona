        BrowserID provides a <b>simple</b> and <b>sophisticated</b>
        login process that your <b>users will love</b>.  It can be
        integrated in three easy steps:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="number">1.</div>
      <p><b>Enable BrowserID:</b> Include the BrowserID JavaScript library in your site by adding a script tag to your <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt></p>

      <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://browserid.org/include.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="number">2.</div>
      <p>
        <b>Identify the User:</b> Instead of displaying a form on your
        site which takes a username and password, use the BrowserID
        JavaScript API when the user clicks your login button:
      </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">navigator.id.getVerifiedEmail(function(assertion) {
    if (assertion) {
        // This code will be invoked once the user has successfully
        // selected an email address they control to log in with.
    } else {
        // something went wrong!  the user isn't logged in.
    }
});
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Upon a successful login, you'll be called back with
        an <i>assertion</i>, a string containing a signed claim that proves
        the user is who they say they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b> While completely optional, you might consider
        replacing your login/signin button with a pretty BrowserID button:
        
        <div class="buttonbox">
          <div><img src="i/sign_in_red.png"></div>
          <div><img src="i/sign_in_blue.png"></div>
          <div><img src="i/sign_in_orange.png"></div>
          <div><img src="i/sign_in_green.png"></div>
          <div><img src="i/sign_in_grey.png"></div>
        </div>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <div class="number">3.</div>
      <p>
        <b>Verify the User's Identity:</b> You must verify the <i>assertion</i>
        is authentic, and extract the user's email address from it.
        The easiest way to do these is to use the
        free verification service provided by BrowserID.
      </p><p>
        To use it, you send a request
        to <tt>https://browserid.org/verify</tt> with two GET parameters:
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li> <tt>assertion</tt>: The encoded assertion
          <li> <tt>audience</tt>: The hostname and optional port of your site
        </ol>
      <p>
        The verifier will check the the assertion was meant for your site and
        is valid, here's an example:
      </p>
        <pre><code>$ curl "https://browserid.org/verify?assertion=&lt;ASSERTION&gt;&audience=mysite.com"
{
    "status": "okay",
    "email": "lloyd@mozilla.com",
    "audience": "mysite.com",
    "valid-until": 1308859352261,
    "issuer": "browserid.org:443"
}
</pre></code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b> You may choose to validate assertions on your own
        server.  While a bit more complicated you can reduce your
        dependencies on others.  Refer
        to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Verified_Email_Protocol">the
        specification</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/tree/master/verifier">source for the reference
        validator</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <p><b>Complete the log in!</b>  Having completed the steps
        above, you can trust that the present user really owns the
        email address returned by the verifier.  You don't need to
        perform any additional authentication unless you want to!
        From here, you can perform whatever post-authentication steps
        you like.
      </p>
